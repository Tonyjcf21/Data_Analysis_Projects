# Learning Data Analysis/Science

Here I'm going to upload the files that I create while learning data science.

**Titanic** is a solution to the classic Titanic **Machine Learning** project from Kaggle.
 - Titanic2.ipynb contains the code.
 - train.csv and test.csv contain the data provided by Kaggle to make the analysis and the predictions.

**HousePricing** is also a **machine learning** project from Kaggle.
 - HousePricing.ipynb contains the code.
 - train.csv and test.csv contain the data provided by Kaggle.

Cars is a very simple **data analysis** and **machine learning** project.
 - carros_simple.ipynb contains the code.
 - car.data contain the data used to make the analysis.
 

The rest are things I've found useful to learn and practice.

**Deforestation** is a project from the Udacity's **SQL** course.
 - Deforestation_Report.pdf is the report containing relevant information about the csv files, including the queries.

**SalesAnalysis** is a project from Keith Galli that I found interesting.

**NYSE Project** is a simple project on SpreadSheets using simple analysis and forecasting methods.
