Dear SellerX team,

Every folder contains the required files for each task.

 - Excel:

 Contains the Google Sheet file with two tabs: Data and Results.

 - Python:

 Contains the .csv with the required table, the .ipynb with the 
 python code, graphs and explanations of results and the .html,
which has the same info as the Jupyter notebook but is intended
to be read.

 - SQL:

 Contains table_creation.sql where I answered the first SQL 
 question. Also, the queries.sql where you can find the
 solution for the rest of the SQL questions. Finally, the 
 .csv files containing the results from the queries are inside
the folder "results_from_queries".
